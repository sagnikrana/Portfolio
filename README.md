# About Me
I am graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am enrolled under Business Intelligence Data Analytics program and currently working as Business Intelligence & Data Science Intern at [Gridwise](https://gridwise.io/). I like solving problems in business and my interest lies toward predictive modeling, centralizing data to evaluate KPIs and providing new leads toward the expansion of the business. <br>
I like pool, axe-throwing, watching soccer and playing cricket(a game played by Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and Carribean).

# What I hope to learn
I believe the ability to tell stories with data needs special skill. I am expecting to learn the art of delivering value through data, not just information. When we present visualizations, we generally deal with a large set of audiences. Most of the people are from difference culture and background. We cannot assume that everyone will be able to get the point through visualization right away. Many people suffer with [color blindness](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/acquired-colour-vision-defects), which makes the color perception challenging for them. I expect to learn all these techniques in this course.
I feel that visualization, more or less, is like google. The less time we spend in it to glean information, the more valuable it becomes. I hope after taking this course, I will be able to take my visualization skills to one more step ahead.
