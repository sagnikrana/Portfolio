Person-1: Employee at Environmental Consultants

Their office is next to our cabin and I went ahead and asked for few couple of minutes. As their company is well known for vegetation management consulting, field services, and remote sensing/software consulting services to the utility industry, I felt that he must have a touch with the decision making process in terms of environment when dealing with the projects. I felt he is the best person to discuss and deal with the processes of my project.

<b> a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story:</b>

The class is my target audience. I feel that most of the people here in class have never seen a solid fuel will be moved with the strong statistics presented in the class. The main aim is to identify the causes and face the numbers presented in the presentation, and try to spread awareness among the masses as much as we can. Removing and coping with poverty is difficult but addressing the story is not.

I hope after the presentation, all my colleagues in the class will have idea about the indoor air pollution and will help people to understand and mitigate the risk

Person-2: Professor at Indian Institute of Foreign Trade

At IIFT New Delhi, environment is considered as one of the most important factors when they deal with national/international level project. The professor has done a PhD in marketing management and has continuosly travelled to remote places of the world for various projects. As her institute considers projects related to environmental solutions in India and has exposure to most of the poor countries of the world, I believe she can judge my end results far better than anyone else.

Person-3: My colleage at CMU

He is very good at visualizations story lineups. From a student's point of view, I wanted to understand what is making my story weak, hence I chose this person to review my story.



<b>c. your interview script:</b>

Person-1:

Me: Could you provide some of the insights in this story ?
(After explaining the story and showing the visualizations simultenously)

He: The topic is really good and covers most of the aspects. Indoor pollution is truly neglected by world media and the politicians. The overall picture looks good. The one part which concerns me is the number of different regions mentioned in the graphs. It is quite unclear and does not allow me to put focus on one single thing. It would be really good if you could group them together or remove the ones which are not important. COntext is good and I am happy that you are taking up this project

Me: Thanks a lot

Person-2:

Me: Hello Ma'am, could you please provide some feedback on the visualizations and the story ?
(After explaining the story and showing the visualizations simultenously)

She: I liked the visualizations, specially the animations. The time series data is really telling a story and some important facts are being deduced about GDP and access to clean fuel. However, I am not sure about the call to action of this project. You mentioned that call to action is to identify the causes of household pollution and acknowledge it. My question is - then what ? The right call of action should be putting some effort in mitigating the risk which we are witnessing here. Everyone should get a chance in future to make someone aware if there is a case of indoor air pollution.

Me: Sure, I will re-think on this one and will try to improve.

Person-3:

Me: Hey! I just wanted to check with you my new project. Do you have 5 minutes.
(After explaining the story and showing the visualizations simultenously)

He: Everything looks fine, but this particlar map(deaths per country) does not seem to be informative. I mean, deaths in China and India are so high that all the colors for otehr countries are gettign suppressed. So if you simply remove this one and can go on with the area graphs, it would be absolutely fine.

Me: Thanks a lot!


d. the findings from your interviews:

Person 1 figured out data wrangling was needed. There were too many regions mentioned in the data and they were cauing issues in visualization. I did data wrangling in python and removed extra regions. The graphs are much cleaner now.

Person 2 identified that the end goal of this story was not upto the mark

Person 3 identified that one of the maps regarding the deaths due to indoor air pollution is not yielding sufficient information.


<b>e. changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified:</b>

* Removed the map which was not presenting enough visualizations.
* Re-arranged the story lineup.
* Thought about the end result in a deeper way.
* Re-written the description for few visualizations.
* Completed the data wrangling and came up with fewer regions in the world.
