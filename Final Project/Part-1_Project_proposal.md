## Overview - Indoor Air pollution

### Outline:

If you are using natural gas or electricity to cook your food, consider your self lucky than the two billion people who depend on solid fuels for their cooking activities and generic energy needs.

Cooking and heating with solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves results in high levels of indoor air pollution. 

The generated indoor smoke contains health-damaging pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, and the pollution levels may be 20 times higher than accepted level in many cases.<br>
According to the World Health Report 2002 indoor air pollution is responsible for 2.7% of the global burden of disease.<br>
At present time, WHO is working on solid grounds to reduce the diseases and mitigate the risks by educating the masses to move towards the conventional energy sources in high-mortality developing countries.<br>
Below are few of the diseases which occur due to indoor house pollution:
* pneumonia
* stroke
* ischaemic heart disease
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
* lung cancer.

In this project, I will be discussing some facts(below) about the indoor pollution and will try to present it as interesting story.

* Countries which use solid fuels: <br>
    Which parts of world are still using the solid fuels as their main sourse of energy needs and how it has changed over th     e time. This relationship will help us to understand the current trend.
    
* Cooking technologies over the time.<br>
    We will see how the cooking technologies have changed over the time in terms of moving towards a more clean fuel.
    
* Deaths:<br>
    How many deaths have occured in the affected countries and what are the numbers around the world.
    
* Correlations:<br>
    We will discuss the below relationships:<br>
        - Relationship between the income level and dependency on solid fuels<br>
        - Dependency on solid fuels: rural vs. urban<br>
        - Number of deaths related between indoor and outdoor households<br>
        - Indoor air pollution in the context of outdoor pollution<br>


Hopefully, this will be an interesting journey and we will try to figure out the correlations and relationships between different factors, which will enroute the authorities towards a correct dimension of the next course of action.

Here are few of the visualizations which I aim to establish:
